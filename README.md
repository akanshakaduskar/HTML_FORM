This is a simple and elegant login page built using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. The page features a visually appealing background with two circular shapes, and the form itself has a blurred background effect, giving it a modern look.

The form includes fields for username (which accepts email or phone number) and password, as well as a "Log In" button. There are also options to log in using Google or Facebook accounts, which are represented by Font Awesome icons.

The CSS code includes styles for the form, input fields, labels, buttons, and social media icons. It also includes some basic animations and transitions for a smooth user experience.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own login page, and customize it to fit your needs.
